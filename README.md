# CV Application

My first project to practice the basics of the React framework. The primary goal was to get comfortable with the new syntax and using props and state.

The user can add relevant experience one item at a time, and edit/delete each item individually. This functionalty was a bit beyond where I currently am with learning the framework, so there are a lot of hacky solutions and redundant code which I will refactor for more practice later after learning more concepts of React.
